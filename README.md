## Solution of Programming Questions and Implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms

**Data Structure and Algorithm-**
 - _BubbleSort_ 
 - _BinarySearch_
 - _InsertionSort_
 - _SelectionSort_
 - _Stack_ 

**Programming Solution:**
 - _Factorial ->  calculate factorial of a given number (eg. 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6)_
 - _FizzBuzz -> print "fizz" if number is divisible by 3 and "buzz" if number is divisible by 5 and if a number is divisible by both then prints "fizz buzz"_
 - _ReverseString -> returns reverse of input string_
 - _SumTwo -> determines whether or not there exist two elements in array whose sum is equals to given input._
